## How do I download trends.txt manually?
1) Scroll up until you see a file named 'trends.txt', click on it to open it.
2) Press 'copy raw contents' on the right titlebar bit (or click the "Raw" button and press Ctrl + A).
3) Go back to where you have the PeriodicTrends python file (must be same diretory) and create a new file titled 'trends.txt' (exactly like that).
4) Copy the raw contents into the text file.
